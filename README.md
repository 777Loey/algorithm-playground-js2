# Algorithm Playground (JavaScript)

An interactive mini web app to explore core computer science algorithms:
- Linear Search
- Binary Search (requires sorted array)
- Bubble Sort

## Features
- Generate random arrays
- Search for a target value
- Sort the array and see algorithm progress
- Simple UI feedback (highlighting active / found values)

## Tech Stack
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## How to Run
Download the folder and open `index.html` in your browser.

## What I Learned
- Implementing algorithms in code
- Debugging and improving clarity of logic
- Basic DOM manipulation and user interactions
